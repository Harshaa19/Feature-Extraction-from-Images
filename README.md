"# Feature-Extraction-from-Images" 
In the realm of e-commerce, obtaining precise product details from images is crucial, especially when textual descriptions are absent or incomplete. This capability extends beyond e-commerce, impacting healthcare and content moderation, where accurate data, such as product dimensions, weight, volume, and other entity values, are vital for operations.

The challenge of this Project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately extract and predict entity values, such as weight, volume, and dimensions, directly from product images. This task is integral to enhancing the quality of digital marketplaces and improving user experience. The model will predict these values in a predefined format.
